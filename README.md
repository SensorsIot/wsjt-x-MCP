**Control your Amateur Radio station with AI.**

The **WSJT-X MCP Server** bridges the gap between modern AI agents (like Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini) and the popular **WSJT-X** software. It enables your AI assistant to monitor radio traffic, analyze signals, and autonomously conduct QSOs on modes like FT8 and FT4.

---

## ✨ Features

- **🤖 AI-Driven Control**: Exposes WSJT-X functionality via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).
- **📻 Multi-Instance Support**: Control multiple radios/bands simultaneously from a single AI session.
- **⚡ Autonomous QSOs**: "Fire-and-forget" QSO automation—tell the AI to "work that station," and the server handles the Tx sequence (Tx1-Tx5 -> 73).
- **💻 Windows Native**: Designed primarily for Windows, with optional support for Raspberry Pi.
- **🖥️ Web Dashboard**: Premium "Mission Control" web interface for real-time monitoring and manual override.
- **🔊 Live Monitoring**: Stream decoded messages and signal reports directly to the AI context.

## 🚀 Architecture

The MCP Server runs locally on the same machine as your WSJT-X instances (PC or Raspberry Pi). It acts as a middleware, translating MCP requests from the AI Agent into UDP commands for WSJT-X.
